    <h2>Step 5: Document and Repeat</h2>

    <p>
      After completing your project, review and document the successes achieved and lessons learned. Documentation can be helpful for future projects and keeping upper management informed. It also helps to advertise your achievements. It is especially important to advertise anything that improves security, streamlining the developent process, positive affects on sales or ROI and anything else that justifies the time and effort invested. This can help secure future maintenance and update projects.

    <p>
      Speaking of future projects, if you have not already done so, it is time to select another topic to repeat the 5 step process and work to achieving a 5 star website.
